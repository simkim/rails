*   Allow preloading of STI children model associations. Same behaviour as polymorphic one

    *Gauthier Monserand*

*   Add support for enabling or disabling transactional tests per database.

    A test class can now override the default `use_transactional_tests` setting
    for individual databases, which can be useful if some databases need their
    current state to be accessible to an external process while tests are running.

    ```ruby
    class MostlyTransactionalTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
      self.use_transactional_tests = true
      skip_transactional_tests_for_database :shared
    end
    ```

    *Matthew Cheetham*, *Morgan Mareve*

*   Cast `query_cache` value when using URL configuration.

    *zzak*

*   NULLS NOT DISTINCT works with UNIQUE CONSTRAINT as well as UNIQUE INDEX.

    *Ryuta Kamizono*

*   `PG::UnableToSend: no connection to the server` is now retryable as a connection-related exception

    *Kazuma Watanabe*
